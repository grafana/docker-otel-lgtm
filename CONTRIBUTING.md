# Contributing

It's recommended to use the [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for development.

## Building locally

`dev1` is an example of a tag to test locally.

- `mise run build-lgtm dev1` will build the docker image locally.
- `mise run lgtm dev1` will run the docker image locally.

## Linting

- Markdown lint: `mise run lint-markdown`
- Markdown link checker: `mise run lint-links`
- Run all checks: `mise run lint-all`

## Acceptance Tests

Acceptance test cases are defined in `oats.yaml` files in the examples directory. The test cases are run by [oats].

If a test case fails (lets say `examples/nodejs`), follows these steps:

1. Build a new image: `mise run build-lgtm dev1`
2. `oats -timeout 2h -lgtm-version dev1 examples/nodejs` (automatically installed by `mise`)
3. go to <http://localhost:3000>

You can run all everything together using `mise run test`.
