# Using Testcontainers

The provided code demonstrates how to use **Testcontainers** with **Grafana's LGTM stack** to test OpenTelemetry metrics
in a Java application. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Set Up the Testcontainers Environment**:

- The `@Testcontainers` annotation enables the Testcontainers extension for JUnit 5.
- The `@Container` annotation is used to define a `LgtmStackContainer` that runs the Grafana LGTM stack in a Docker
  container.

2. **Configure OpenTelemetry**:

- In the `@BeforeEach` method, system properties are set to configure the OpenTelemetry exporter to send metrics to
  the LGTM stack running in the container.

3. **Run the Application**:

- The `OtelApp` class initializes OpenTelemetry and generates a custom metric (`sold_items`) with attributes (e.g.,
  `tenant`) as well as a span representing the block the code.

4. **Test Exporting Metrics and Traces**:

- The test method `testExportMetricsAndTraces` runs the application and queries the Prometheus and Tempo endpoints
  in the LGTM stack to verify that the metric (`sold_items`) and span have been exported successfully.
- The `Awaitility` library is used to poll the endpoints until the telemetry is found or a timeout occurs.

5. **Debugging with Grafana**:

- The test outputs the Grafana URL (`lgtm.getGrafanaHttpUrl()`) to the console, allowing you to manually inspect the
  telemetry in the Grafana UI if needed.

## Example Usage

1. Start the test using `mvn test`.
2. Check the console output for the Grafana URL.
3. Open the Grafana UI, navigate to the Explore tab, and query the metrics or traces.
4. The test will pass if the metric and span are successfully exported and found in Prometheus and Tempo.

This setup is useful for validating OpenTelemetry instrumentation and ensuring metrics are correctly exported to a
monitoring system.
