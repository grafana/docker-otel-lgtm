## Intended Usage

The intended usage is:

* Quick way to try OSS Grafana with OpenTelemetry.
* Demos, presentations.
* Integration tests for OpenTelemetry instrumentation: Run automated queries against the databases to check if expected metrics/traces/logs are present.

The Docker image is not intended for production monitoring.

## Get the Docker image

The Docker image is available on Docker hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/grafana/otel-lgtm

## Run the Docker image

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -p 4317:4317 --rm -ti grafana/otel-lgtm
```

## Send OpenTelemetry Data

There's no need to configure anything: The Docker image works with OpenTelemetry's defaults.

```sh
# Not needed as these are the defaults in OpenTelemetry:
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
```

## View Grafana

Log in to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with user _admin_ and password _admin_.

## Build the Docker image from scratch

```sh
cd docker/
docker build . -t grafana/otel-lgtm
```
